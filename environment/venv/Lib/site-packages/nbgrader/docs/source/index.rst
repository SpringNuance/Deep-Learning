nbgrader
========

``nbgrader`` is a tool that facilitates creating and grading assignments in the Jupyter notebook. It allows instructors to easily create notebook-based assignments that include both coding exercises and written free-responses. ``nbgrader`` then also provides a streamlined interface for quickly grading completed assignments.

For an overview and demonstration of nbgrader's core functionality, check out the talk on nbgrader given at SciPy 2017:
